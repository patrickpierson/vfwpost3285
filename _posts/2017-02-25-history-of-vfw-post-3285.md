VFW Post 3285 was chartered in 1935 and was named for a Frederick native, John R. Webb who made the supreme sacrifice for his country in October, 1918 during World War I.  The post was first located in the building on top of the hill where West Patrick Street intersects with College Terrace and Catoctin Avenue - 500 West Patrick Street.  

With membership based on U.S. ARMED Forces personnel who had participated in Foreign Service campaigns recognized by USA MEDALS OR AWARDS, Membership in the post-World War II era grew rapidly to over 500, plus an active Ladies Auxiliary.

In June 1951, the Post purchased the Old Catoctin Country Club property, including the 9-hole Golf Course, Tennis Courts and present Clubhouse building and established its headquarters here.  Ex-Senator Charles C. McMathias represented our Post and Commander Austin Bruchey in the negotiations.  A large macadamized parking area later covered most of the clubhouse grounds.

This major move resulted in an increased membership and a more active Post, particularly in the use of the Golf Course and Dining Room which rapidly became a very popular meeting and dining location for native Fredericktonians, service clubs and other organizations.

In 1967 the Post constructed an Olympic-size Swimming Pool and bath-house, moving the No. 9 golf green to its present location.  This Post activity has proven to be extremely popular with members and Fredericktonians.

With the growth of the Post and the improved facilities Membership growth increased which also brought about increased participation by the Post members in the main Patriotic, Community Service and Youth Activity programs, which are the hallmark of strong VFW Posts.

Currently, the Post has over 800 members, despite the fact that membership criteria is more demanding than that in other service organizations.  The Post Quartermaster, who functions under the Post Commander and 11-member Executive Committee, conducts day-to-day operation of the Post.
General meetings of all Post members are scheduled on the first Monday of each, while members of the Executive Committee meet on the first and third Mondays of each month.
