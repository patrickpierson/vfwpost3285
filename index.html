            <h2>Commander’s Welcome Letter</h2>
          </div>
            <p>Welcome to the John R. Webb VFW Post 3285, I’d like to take this opportunity to welcome you to our post! Anyone on Active Duty 
               or any Veteran who has deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, The Gulf War, Vietnam, Korea, or one of the many Operations where hazardous 
               duty pay, or a campaign medal was awarded is eligible to join the VFW. In addition, we have an Auxiliary that is available to 
               eligible family members and we would love to have you join. If this is your first VFW Post or you are a transfer, it is our desire
               to make this your permanent “Home” as a Veteran.</p>
            <p>I would like to invite you to attend a General Membership meeting as soon as you become a member.  Our Monthly General Membership
               meeting, is held the 1st Monday of each month, at 7:00PM. We will ask you for a brief introduction about your military experience,
               your family, and to tell us about any goals you may have through our organization.  We have a lounge (canteen) and the Resturant
               Capital Crave on our upper floor for dining. There are incredible activites in these areas and we are excited about our future. </p>
            <p>If you are interested in a Sponsor/Mentor, please contact the Commander at {{ site.officers[0].number }} or email the Post Quartermaster at
              <a href="mailto:contact@vfwpost3285.org?Subject=VFW" target="_top">contact@vfwpost3285.org</a> with VFW in the Subject line,
              and you will be contacted.</p>
            <p>Lastly you can also connect with us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VFWPost3285/">Facebook<i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a> and
